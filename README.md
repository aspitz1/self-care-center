# Introduction
In need of some good energy? I know I do as I am learning JavaScript. Relax in a soothing environment with a random affirmation or mantra. Do you have a favorite affirmation or mantra and want to see it displayed in a box with some nice animations? This Self Care Center web toy has you covered there too! Just enter your phrase in the custom form and take a deep breath. Relax.
# Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
# Functions
On the landing page you will be given the option of two radio buttons, affirmation or mantra. Depending on your choice the background color will change to try and set the mood for relaxation. Alternatively, you can choose to enter a custom phrase. When you choose that function a form will be displayed with the choice of affirmation or mantra and a text box to enter your phrase. Upon submitting ether options you will be given a few seconds to take some breaths with an animation that gives the feeling of breathing. Then ether the random phrase or your custom phrase will fade into view. Need another? No problem. There is a reset button to start again.

This project could be added on to with options to favorite and save phrases, as well as some other features. In addition to the MVP I included error handling, a custom form for users to add their own messages, and intermediate CSS styling.
